# UIstate Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating UIstate's revolutionary approach to state management using the DOM as the source of truth.

## Directory Structure

Examples are organized into three categories based on complexity:

### Basic Examples

These examples demonstrate core UIstate concepts with minimal code:

- [Button Toggle](./basic/button-toggle/index.html) - Demonstrates Attribute-Driven State Inheritance (ADSI) with a simple toggle button

### Intermediate Examples

These examples show more complex patterns and combinations of UIstate concepts:

- Coming soon

### Advanced Examples

These examples demonstrate the full power of UIstate with complex applications:

- Coming soon

## Learning Path

We recommend starting with the basic examples to understand the core concepts before moving on to the more complex examples. Each example includes a link to detailed documentation explaining the concepts demonstrated.

## Key Concepts

- **Attribute-Driven State Inheritance (ADSI)** - Using data attributes as the source of truth for state
- **DOM-Centric Approach** - Leveraging the DOM instead of fighting against it
- **CSS-Driven UI** - Using CSS selectors to automatically respond to state changes
- **Minimal JavaScript** - Using JavaScript only to update state, not directly manipulate the DOM
