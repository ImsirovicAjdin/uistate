# Basic UIstate Examples

These examples demonstrate the core concepts of UIstate with minimal code, focusing on the fundamental principles that make UIstate revolutionary.

## Available Examples

- [Button Toggle](./button-toggle/index.html) - A simple toggle button that demonstrates Attribute-Driven State Inheritance (ADSI)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Attribute-Driven State Inheritance (ADSI)

ADSI is UIstate's core concept where:

- The DOM itself becomes the source of truth for state through data attributes
- CSS automatically responds to state changes via attribute selectors
- JavaScript only needs to update attributes, not directly manipulate styles
- State is visible and debuggable directly in the DOM inspector

### Separation of Concerns

These examples demonstrate UIstate's clean separation between:

- **Structure** (HTML)
- **General Styling** (styles.css)
- **State-Driven Styling** (state.css)
- **Behavior** (JavaScript)

This separation makes code more maintainable, easier to understand, and more performant.

## Learning Approach

Each example is intentionally minimal, focusing on demonstrating a single concept clearly without unnecessary complexity. This makes it easier to understand the revolutionary aspects of UIstate's approach.

For more detailed explanations, each example links to comprehensive documentation.
