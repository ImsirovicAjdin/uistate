## Examples

Explore our [documentation and examples](./docs/index.html) to see UIstate in action:

- Range sliders with different state derivation approaches
- Button toggles with CSS state projection
- Font adjusters with domain-based state management
- And more!

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Philosophy

UIstate challenges traditional assumptions in web development by using the DOM as the source of truth for state, leveraging CSS variables and data attributes for state storage, and using the CSS cascade for state inheritance and derivation.
