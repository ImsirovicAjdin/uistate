# Contributing to @uistate/core

## Current Contribution Policy

**@uistate/core is currently not accepting external contributions.**

This project represents a focused approach to event-driven state management. I'm maintaining tight control over the architecture and implementation to keep the library lean, coherent, and production-ready.

## How You Can Help

While I'm not accepting code contributions, you can still support the project:

- **Report bugs** via GitHub issues
- **Share your experience** using UIstate in your projects
- **Spread the word** about path-based reactive state
- **Provide feedback** on the API and documentation

## Future Contributions

This policy may evolve as the project matures.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for questions about usage or to report bugs.
