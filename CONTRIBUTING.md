# Contributing to @uistate/core

## Current Contribution Policy

**@uistate/core is currently not accepting external contributions.**

This project represents a novel approach to DOM-based state management using CSS custom properties. As the creator, I'm maintaining tight control over the architecture and implementation to ensure the revolutionary concepts remain coherent and focused.

## How You Can Help

While I'm not accepting code contributions, you can still support the project:

- **Report bugs** via GitHub issues
- **Share your experience** using UIstate in your projects  
- **Spread the word** about DOM-based state management
- **Provide feedback** on the API and documentation

## Future Contributions

This policy may evolve as the project matures and the core concepts become more established in the community.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for questions about usage or to report bugs.
